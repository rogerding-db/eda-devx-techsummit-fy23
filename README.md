# Tech Summit FY23: Developer Experience and EDA

This repository can be used to demonstrate the first party development experience on Databricks. It focuses on exploratory data analysis using `bamboolib` and how to incorporate software engineering best practices with Databricks notebooks.  The majority of this repo is structured as a companion for the example article "Software engineering best practices for Databricks notebooks" ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/best-practices.html) | [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/notebooks/best-practices) | [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/notebooks/best-practices.html)).  

Going through these examples, you will:

* Learn more about the building blocks of `bamboolib` - IPyWidgets
* Learn how to use `bamboolib` to explore, clean, and visualize raw data
* Extend the base functionality of `bamboolib` with plugins

<br>

* Add notebooks to Databricks Repos for version control.
* Extracts portions of code from one of the notebooks into a shareable component.
* Test the shared code.
* Automatically run notebooks in git on a schedule using a Databricks job.
* Optionally, apply CI/CD to the notebooks and the shared code.

The example is hands-on. We recommend working it step-by-step to learn how to apply these techniques to your own Databricks notebooks.
